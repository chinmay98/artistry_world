		                    	<p><strong>Edgar Degas</strong>  was a French artist famous for his paintings, sculptures, prints, and drawings. He is especially identified with the subject of dance; more than half of his works depict dancers. He is regarded as one of the founders of Impressionism, although he rejected the term, preferring to be called a realist. He was a superb draftsman, and particularly masterly in depicting movement, as can be seen in his rendition of dancers, racecourse subjects and female nudes. His portraits are notable for their psychological complexity and for their portrayal of human isolation.</p>

		                    	<ul>
		                    	   <li>Upon his return to France in 1859, Degas moved into a Paris studio large enough to permit him to begin painting The Bellelli Family—an imposing canvas he intended for exhibition in the Salon, although it remained unfinished until 1867. He also began work on several history paintings: Alexander and Bucephalus and The Daughter of Jephthah in 1859–60; Sémiramis Building Babylon in 1860; and Young Spartans around 1860.<br></li>
		                    	   
		                    	   <li> He exhibited at the Salon for the first time in 1865, when the jury accepted his painting Scene of War in the Middle Ages, which attracted little attention. Although he exhibited annually in the Salon during the next five years, he submitted no more history paintings, and his Steeplechase—The Fallen Jockey (Salon of 1866) signaled his growing commitment to contemporary subject matter.<br></li> 
		                    	   
		                           <li>Degas produced a number of works, many depicting family members. One of Degas's New Orleans works, A Cotton Office in New Orleans, garnered favorable attention back in France, and was his only work purchased by a museum (the Pau) during his lifetime.</li>
		                        </ul>

		                    	<p>During his life, public reception of Degas's work ranged from admiration to contempt. As a promising artist in the conventional mode, Degas had a number of paintings accepted in the Salon between 1865 and 1870. </p>
		                    	<p>Degas's work was controversial, but was generally admired for its draftsmanship. His La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans, or Little Dancer of Fourteen Years, which he displayed at the sixth Impressionist exhibition in 1881, was probably his most controversial piece; some critics decried what they thought its "appalling ugliness" while others saw in it a "blossoming".</p>
		                    	<p>Recognized as an important artist in his lifetime, Degas is now considered "one of the founders of Impressionism". Though his work crossed many stylistic boundaries, his involvement with the other major figures of Impressionism and their exhibitions, his dynamic paintings and sketches of everyday life and activities, and his bold color experiments, served to finally tie him to the Impressionist movement as one of its greatest artists.</p>
		                    	<p>Degas's paintings, pastels, drawings, and sculptures are on prominent display in many museums, and have been the subject of many museum exhibitions and retrospectives.</p>

It is interesting to note the contrast in the expressions and gestures of the dancers who are rehearsing and ones who are waiting to perform.

								 Also known as The Rape and described as “the most theatrical of all Degas’s compositions of modern life”, this famous work depicts an intriguing scene of a man and a partially clad woman in a bedroom. The scene remains a mystery due to which it is referred to as the most puzzling major work by Degas. Scholars have attempted to read it as a representation of literary works of the time but none of the explanations have been universally accepted. </span>

Lepic was a French artist and archaeologist, and a friend of Degas. The other man in the painting towards far left is writer Daniel Halevy, another friend of Degas. The painting is known for its political commentary and the placement of Lepic’s hat to cover the Strasbourg statue is often pointed out by art enthusiasts.

It depicts a woman staring dully with a glass of Absinthe in front of her. A man who looks like an alcoholic sits beside her. Degas asked the famous actress Ellen Andrée and Bohemian artist Marcellin Desboutin to pose as two absinthe addicts in his favorite Parisian cafe, the Café de la Nouvelle-Athènes in Paris.</span>

Advent of factories meant that the private milliner’s shops with handmade works were becoming obsolete. This artwork is not only viewed as a painting about vanity but also as an artist’s tribute to a dying artistic profession he respected."></a>

							The most famous painting by Edgar Degas is a representation of the increasing social isolation in Paris during its stage of rapid growth. It depicts a woman staring dully with a glass of Absinthe in front of her. A man who looks like an alcoholic sits beside her. Degas asked the famous actress Ellen Andrée and Bohemian artist Marcellin Desboutin to pose as two absinthe addicts in his favorite Parisian cafe, the Café de la Nouvelle-Athènes in Paris.
